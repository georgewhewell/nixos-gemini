# Power, PMIC, battery and DVFS

Status: BQ25896 status observation is BOUND-UNVERIFIED; Cycle18 FG preflight
is read-only and cleanly removed; battery, charging policy, and DVFS remain
UNKNOWN or IMPLEMENTED-INACTIVE.

The current board source places the charger candidate at I2C0/0x6b and keeps
the VGPU/FAN candidates disabled (linux-gemini-platform@28c471502:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt6797-gemini-pda.dts:351-390,618-638). The live
full Stage2 image binds 3-006b to bq25890-charger, exposing TI
BQ25896, online=1, status=Not charging, and charge_type=N/A. This is a
read-only status observation, not proof of charging or battery operation.

Cycle18's second probe used gemini-live-fgadc with activate=N and reported:

> exact-active state ckpdn=0x1270 con0=0x29 osr=0x8, no child/power_supply, cleanly removed.

The exact evidence is
/mnt/Home/src/gemini-live-probe-cycle18-fg-preflight-20260830; its
`RESULT:1-3` has remote_rc=0 and its
`/mnt/Home/src/gemini-live-probe-cycle18-fg-preflight-20260830/dmesg-applied:1895-1901`
records clean overlay removal.
The current full NixOS image intentionally composes InputObserve, not
DeviceActivation: the fuel-gauge child is disabled in the runtime DT.

The FG result does not establish battery capacity, voltage/current calibration,
CHR_STAT routing, charger control, or a safe charging policy. The exact BQ
variant beyond the compatible identity and the physical battery topology remain
could not determine. No raw PMIC or charger writes are authorized by this
evidence.

DVFSP handoff reaches state=ready and late_validation=passed in the live
dmesg, but no CPUFreq policy or OPP sysfs exists; classify DVFS as
IMPLEMENTED-INACTIVE. The next gates are a read-only charger/battery identity
record and a separately reviewed fixed-OPP DVFS test.
